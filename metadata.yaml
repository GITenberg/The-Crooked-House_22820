description: Three generations of the Anglo-Greek Leonides family live together in
  a large, seemingly crooked house, under the patriarchy of Aristide. He is an ageing
  millionaire who originally moved to England from Smyrna and, in the novel, spends
  his remaining days in the company of his second wife Brenda, fifty years his junior.
  After the old man is poisoned with his own eye medicine (eserine), his granddaughter
  Sophia tells her fianc√© Charles Hayward, the story's first person narrator, that
  she can't marry him until the killer is apprehended; so, desperate for her hand
  in marriage, he begins his own investigation...
